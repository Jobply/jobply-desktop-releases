### Important for macOS Users

When you try to open Jobply for the first time, you may see a security warning like this:

To bypass this:  
1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.  
2. Scroll down to the bottom.  
3. Click **Open Anyway** (this button only appears if you have already tried to open the app at least once).
